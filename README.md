# GIMP Resynthesizer Plugin Suite

A set of plugins for the GIMP image editing app.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bootchk/resynthesizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bootchk/resynthesizer)

A library implementing the "resynthesizer" algorithm for texture transfer among images.

And a suite of plugins, that use the algorithm, for the GIMP image processing application.
The plugins do _not_ come with GIMP, they are "third-party" plugins.

## Acknowledgements

Paul Harrison had the original idea and implementation.  He did the hard work, took the leap of faith and experimented with a new algorithm.  His [website](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/) has many examples of using the Resynthesizer, links to an explanation of the algorithm, and other cool ideas.

I fixed a few bugs (due to changes in GIMP), rewrote the Scheme plugins into Python, wrote a few plugins, made it better deal with alpha (transparency), threaded it, and made it into a reentrant library in C.

Rob Antonishen contributed the basis for one plugin.  Several people have helped with the build process and with translations.
