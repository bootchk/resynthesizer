Notes:

The selection:

In prior versions, you could pass the same layer as the target and corpus.
Since there is only one selection, the selection was the target and the inverse
of the selection was the corpus.  But if you wanted to pass a different image and layer
as the corpus, you needed to invert the selection in that image.

This feature was a source of confusion for users and programmers.
Here, this feature is abolished.  The selection in the corpus layer is the corpus,
not the inverse of the selection.

This only eliminates one use: synthesizing a selection from the inverse of the selection
in the same drawable.  If you need to do that, copy the drawable to another image and
create a selection there that is the inverse of the selection in the original.
The heal selection plugin does that for you.

The alpha:

In prior versions the alpha was treated like a color channel, and matched during resynthesis.
Transparent pixels (which Gimp arbitrarily gives the color black in some circumstances)
were not distinguished.  In certain cases  with transparency, transparent pixels were synthesized
into the target, as good matches for black.

Here, we don't match the alpha channel between target and corpus.
We don't generate any alpha in the target, instead we leave the target alpha unaltered.
We use the alpha to determine what pixels are in the target and corpus,
(similar to a selection mask.)
Any totally transparent pixel in the target selection IS synthesized,
I.E. a color is generated (but since it is totally transparent, you don't see it.)
Any partially transparent target pixel is also synthesized, except as stated,
the alpha is not matched (so colors from opaque areas of the corpus
could be synthesized into partially transparent areas of the target.)
Any totally transparent pixel in the corpus is not in the corpus, i.e. never matched.
Any partially transparent pixel in the corpus is a candidate for matching.
A color from a partially transparent pixel in the corpus could be synthesized
into an opaque area of the target.
Again, the transparency of the target is retained even as new colors are synthesized.

Tiling: (see parameters horizontal and vertical tiling)
This means we synthesize a target that is *seamlessly* tileable.
We treat the target as a sphere, wrapping a coord outside the target around
to the opposite side.
It doesn't make tiles in the target, it makes a target that is suitable as a tile.
