This package is a set of plugins for use with the Gimp program.
The package includes:

- resynthesizer plugin engine (without a GUI)
- resynthesizer-gui plugin control panel for the engine
- various plugins (in Python language) that call the resynthesizer engine

Version
=======

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite and is multithreaded.  Otherwise, functionally the same except when compiled threaded it is nondeterministic.  See ChangeLog for more discussion.

Version 1.0 derives from version 0.16 maintained by the original author.

See the NEWS file.

Installing
==========

These are instructions for most users who received a pre-built distribution (with resynthesizer.exe and resynthesizer-gui.exe already compiled).

1.  Remove any older versions (see below.)

2.  Copy all files to your home gimp directory for plugins:

~/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins (Linux)
c:\Doc...Settings\username\gimp-2.6\plug-ins (Windows)


Removing older versions
=======================

You should manually remove these older versions before installing this package.  They probably do NOT still work, and are duplicates at best.

They might be found in the usual places:

Linux

~/.gimp-2.x/plug-ins (.exe and .py)
~/.gimp-2.x/scripts  (.scm)
/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts (.scm)
/usr/local/lib/gimp/2.0/plugins (.exe and .py)

Windows

c:\Program Files\GIMP-2.0\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins (.exe and .py)
c:\Program Files\GIMP-2.0\share\gimp\2.0\plug-ins (.scm)
c:\Doc...Settings\username\gimp-2.6\plug-ins  (.exe and .py)
c:\Doc...Settings\username\gimp-2.6\scripts  (.scm)


Dependencies
============

This discusses dependencies within the package (a concern of users, not of a builder.) Resynthesizer.exe is the base plugin.  All other plugins only depend on it as the engine.  All other plugins are optional.  Resynthesizer-gui.exe is the control panel for the engine, offering the "Map>Resynthesize" menu item.  Without it, all other plugins will still work.


Building on Linux
=================

It builds with GNU build tools.  Many of the build files (Makefile.am, configure.in, etc.) were hacked from the gimp-plugin-template 2.2.0.

To build and install a clean distribution, just ...

  ./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

It installs to the shared Gimp directories.

Note the default gcc flags seem to be: -g -O2 -Wall.
To optimize more, pass the CFLAGS (perogative of the builder to alter compilation):

make CFLAGS=-O3


Building on other platforms
===========================

(On the darkside OS, who hijacked a common word for fenestration)

I use MinGW and MSYS.
(Use mingw-get to download gnu build tools perl, automake etc.)
However it doesn't install plugins properly.
You will need to copy files to the proper Gimp plugin install directory,
typically from:

c:\MSYS\1.0\usr\local\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins
to:
c:\Doc...Settings\yourname\.gimp-2.6\plug-ins
