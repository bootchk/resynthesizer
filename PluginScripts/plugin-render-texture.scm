;; Create new image having texture synthesized from the selection.
;; Works best if selection is natural (fractal).
;; Can work with man-made regular texture.
;; Works worst with man-made, structured but not regular, symbols.
;; Sometimes called rendering a texture.
;;
;; Requires resynthesizer plug-in.

;; Author:
;; lloyd konneker, lkk, bootch at nc.rr.com, itr-tert

;; Version:
;; 1.0 lkk 2010-07-15 Initial version
;; 1.1 lkk 2011-04-10 Fixed a bug with layer types impacting greyscale images.
;; later versions, see git log

;;
;; The effect for users:
;; Similar to "Fill resynthesized pattern" except:
;;   - here the arguments are reversed: you select a texture and create a new image
;;     instead of selecting an area and choosing a pattern.
;;   - here the result is less random (since Fill resynthesized adds noise.)
;; Different from tiling since:
;;   - seamless and irregular pattern
;;
;; The continuum of randomness versus speed:
;;   - Filters.Map.Tile is fast but has seams and regular pattern (even if you use "Make Seamless" first.)
;;   - Filter.Render.Texture a tile followed by tiling is seamless but still has regularity.
;;   - Filte.Render.Texture an entire image is slower but seamless and moderately irregular.
;;   - Edit.Fill with resynthesized pattern is slowest but seamless and highly irregular, unpatterned.
;;
;; This filter is not tiling (instead resynthesizing) but makes
;; an image that you can then use to tile with especially if
;; you choose the option to make the edges suitable for tiling.
;;
;; IN: The selection (or the entire active drawable) is the source of texture and is not changed.
;; OUT New image, possibly resized canvas, same scale and resolution.
;;
;; TODO a quality setting
