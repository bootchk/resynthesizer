;; 1.1 lkk 2009-9-21 Translate to python.
;; later versions, see git log

;; Increase image/canvas size and synthesize outer band from edge of original.

;; The effect for users:
;; widens the field of view, maintaining perspective of original
;; Should be undoable, except for loss of selection.
;; Should work on any image type, any count of layers and channels (although only active layer is affected.)
;;
;; IN: Nothing special.  The selection is immaterial but is not preserved.
;; OUT larger layer and image.  All other layers not enlarged.
